# My Machine Learning Repo:

#### Description: 

This repository contains most of my coding practices, courseworks, projects and other miscalleanous files. 

I aim for the presentable parts of my code to be in notebooks.

### AiCore



AiCore is a Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp that I'm taking part in.\
This directory contains the notebooks and scripts that I've created during my time at AiCore. \
The bootcamp focused on: 
 
 - Python Programming
 - Webscraping
 - Data Cleaning with Pandas
 - Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines. 
 - Cloud Engineering: Cloud computing, API's, Docker, AWS.

### Data Science Practice
 
I wanted to build familiarity with the tasks of a Data Scientist/ Data Engineer, so in my spare time \
I try to do some independent projects that are applicable to the real world. An example would be: 

- Sales Analysis: I gained some proficiency with Pandas and Regex in this project. I analysed some Sales Data\
which was provided by a Youtuber: Keith Galli. In particular I answered some common business type questions 
using the data. 

- Reviews Classifier: Project to gain familiarity with Sci-Kit Learn. Fit an SVM model to classify Amazon reviews into "Positive"/"Negative" categories. Used Tfidf vectorizer to transform the data into training/test data and optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. Model can be downloaded \
  and imported using Pickle from Models directory.

### Digit Classification

Initially I started learning about Machine Learning through a course: Machine Learning: Stanford University \
on Coursera by Andrew Ng. The first thing I did after completing this course was I thought let me apply some of the
new skills I've gained, so I built a Digit Classification Model from scratch on the MNIST dataset. When I say from scratch,
I mean the implementation of key aspects of the Neural Network were written by me. In particular I wrote functions to:

- Feed data through the Neural Network.
- Compute gradient for gradient descent using Backpropogation. 
- Initialise random weights/parameters for our model. 
- Compute the cost function/ error function. 
- Generate my own pixel pictures of Digits and to test my model.

### LeetCode and Project Euler:

Both of these are platforms I used to solve coding questions and build my confidence at coding. LeetCode focuses more on DSA,
whereas Project Euler focuses more on Number Theory. These directories contain the code I used to solve these problems.

### Stanford ML - Coursera:

As mentioned above, I initially engaged with Machine Learning through this course. This course focused on the fundamentals of 
machine learning and algorithms. I gained familiarity with the following topics through assignments on Matlab:

- Linear Regression and Logisitic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Anomaly Detection
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis
- Optical Character Recognition

The course was split into 10 weeks, each week ended with a mandatory coding Project. This directory contains PDF's 
for the assignments each week and the Matlab code I used to build a model for that assignment.

### Miscellaneous: 

Here I store some general scripts I've written when I've had an interview, or I've read something interesting and thought 
it would be fun to implement.
